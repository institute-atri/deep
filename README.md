# üßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è DEEP - Digital Evidence Evaluation Profiler üßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

DEEP aims to improve the ability of law enforcement and legal professionals to solve crimes by analyzing large volumes
of data related to criminal cases. Using natural language processing and learning techniques
machine, the software can extract relevant information, identify hidden patterns and suggest connections that can
not be immediately apparent to human investigators.

- Digital: Reflects the focus on technology and digital data, which are crucial in modern forensic analyses.
- Evidence: Emphasizes the system's primary goal, which is to handle evidence in criminal cases.
- Evaluation: Indicates that the system not only collects but also evaluates the evidence, a crucial step in forensic
  analysis.
- Profiler: Suggests that the system goes beyond mere evidence evaluation to also provide a more in-depth profile or
  analysis, which can be especially useful in complex investigations.
